1. Using your favorite DB client, design and create a database table called `people` that would store the information presented above (create a database first if you don’t have any existing ones to play with). Don’t bother with creating any keys or indices for now, just create the five columns. Copy and paste the SQL query generated by the client below (it should start with `create table` or something similar; if it is difficult to find the query generated by your client, ask for assistance):

    ```postgresql
    create table people
(
	Id int,
	"First Name" text,
	"Last Name" text,
	"Year of Birth" int,
	"Year of Death" int
);
    ```

2. **Manually** create a query or a series of queries that would fill the table with the information above. Put the query/queries below:

    ```postgresql
    ... INSERT INTO "people" ("id", "First Name", "Last Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death")
        VALUES (1, 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 1926, 1962),
        (2, 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 1809, 1865),
        (3, 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 1918, 2013),
        (4, 'Winston', 'Churchill', 1874, 1965),
        (5, 'Bill', 'Gates', 1955, null),
        (6, 'Charles', 'Darwin', 1809, 1882),
        (7, 'Pele', null, 1940, null),
        (8, 'Fidel', 'Castro', 1926, null) 
        ...
    ```

3. Create a query that would return everything from the table:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people ...
    ```
    
4. Create a query that would return a single row: the person with the ID of 5.

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people where id = 5 ...
    ```

5. Create a query that would return the four people with the following IDs: 1, 3, 7, 8.

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people where id IN (1, 3, 7, 8) ...
    ```

6. Create a query that would return all the people except the person with the ID of 4 (`Winston Churchill`).

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people where id <> 4 ...
    ```

7. Create a query that would select the first names and last names of the people who were born after 1920:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT "First Name", "Last Name" FROM people where "Year of Birth" > 1920 ...
    ```
    
8. Create a query that would select the IDs of the living people:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT id FROM people where  "Year of Death" IS null ...
    ```
    
9. Create a query that would return the years of birth and the years of death of everyone who has died. The columns should be aliased `b` and `d` respectively.

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT "Year of Birth" as b, "Year of Death" as d FROM people where  "Year of Death" IS NOT NULL ...
    ```
    
10. Create a query that would return the list of all years of birth, without repetition:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT distinct  "Year of Birth" FROM people ...
    ```

11. Create a query that would select the people with either their first or last name starting with an `M`:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people where "First Name" like 'M%' or "Last Name" like 'M%' ...
    ```

12. Create a query that would select the people with both their first and last name starting with an `M`:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people where "First Name" like 'M%' and "Last Name" like 'M%' ...
    ```
    
13. Create a query that would select all the people except those whose last name starts with a `C`:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people where not "Last Name" like 'C%' ...
    ```
    
14. Create a query that would select the people whose first name starts with a letter that precedes `M` in the English alphabet:

    ```postgresql
    ...SELECT * FROM people where "First Name" < 'M%' ...
    ```
    
15. Create a query that would return all the people sorted by their last name alphabetically:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people order by "Last Name" ...
    ```

16. Create a query that would return the first names of the people sorted in the reverse alphabetical order. The column should be aliased `fn`.

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT "First Name" AS fn FROM people order by "First Name" desc  ...
    ```

17. Create a query that would return the people sorted by their year of birth in the descending order, and then (if two or more people share the same year of birth) by their last name alphabetically:

    ```postgresql
    ... SELECT * FROM people order by "Year of Birth" desc, "Last Name" ...
    ```
    
18. Set everyone’s last name to your last name:

    ```postgresql
    ... update people set "Last Name" = 'Lozytskyi' ...
    ```
    
19. Update the first name of everyone who was born before 1900 to your favorite character’s name:

    ```postgresql
    ... update people set "First Name" = 'Tony' where "Year of Birth" < 1900 ...
    ```
    
20. Add 1 to both the year of birth and year of death for everyone whose ID is less than 5:

    ```postgresql
    ... update people set "Year of Birth" = "Year of Birth" + 1, "Year of Death" = "Year of Death" + 1 where id < 5 ...
    ```

21. Delete from the table everyone who died before 2000:

    ```postgresql
    ... DELETE FROM people where "Year of Death" < 2000 ...
    ```

22. Delete everyone from the table:

    ```postgresql
    ... DELETE FROM people ...
    ```
